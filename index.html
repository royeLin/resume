    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <h3>Software enigneer, <a href="https://about.google/">Google</a>, Xindian, Taiwan</h3>
    <p> Aug 2022 - Present (Employed by IMC, supporting google)</p>
    <p>Python/Git/SQL/Multi-thread</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Built Real-time Dashboard</p>
            <p>After distinguishing between different branches and models, 
                new software versions are queued according to the block they belong to, 
                and the statistical data of the test results of the new software version are added at the same time. 
                The tested data will be periodically uploaded to Google database, 
                and then I used SQL to connect the dashboard of the web page with the database.</p>
            <p>It solves the problem of information asymmetry among engineers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Camera CTS automatic uploading with bug reports</p>
            <p>Generate bug reports for the failure cases after tested with each updated software version, 
                and upload the bug reports to the shared resources of the Google internal platform. 
                By developing on the Google platform and then entraining a common credential to create an instance, 
                it solves the problem of limited development due to permissions. 
                I also utilize reverse engineering to explain the usage scenarios of the API on the google platform, 
                and solve the problem of insufficient API usage instructions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Camera CTS function integration</p>
            <p>Import Google Camera App testing function into Camera CTS by taking advantage of the call instance. 
                It provides a situation where users can test the Google Camera App independently, 
                and solve the conflict of shraring variable in multi-thread.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Instant reporting function</p>
            <p>When the  software raises an exception in the abnormal situation, 
                the function will automatically send the trace back messages to the user. 
                It allows engineers to fix on the fly to reduce the cost of software outages.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Develop APIs</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Develop an issue creator API entrained with bug reports based on google issue tracker</li>
                <li>Develop an agent API for uploading bug reports based on google API</li>
                <li>Cross-team development of google camera app testing API</li>
                <li>Develop an API  for uploading test data to the Google database</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assistant Engineer Intern, <a href="http://www.weft.com.tw/">Weft</a>, Xindian, Taiwan</h3>
    <p>July 2018 - Aug 2018</p>
    <p>Labview</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Developed medical electric knife voltage measurement system</p>
            <p>In the development stage, I use the Function Generator to simulate the power output of the electric knife, 
                and use Labview to communicate with the Function Generator to set the frequency and AC to generate the power output, 
                and then communicate with the Digital Multimeter to measure the actual voltage value, 
                and draw the UI to display the measured voltage with time change.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
